# Partials

- partials are used to keep some code seperate if we need to
- we can use partials just by using below method

   `@import 'filename';`
- remember we don't need to add extension while giving filename

## Note

- if we use the simple file names for partials the watch or sass file compiler will also create css files for that partials 
- so 
  -we write _ before the partial file name just like _filename.scss
